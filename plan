sample django project idea:

a site that takes in text data and turns it into structural data and builds a knowledge graph on it and then visualize
 it in the site,

 frontend: vue (to eradicate extra development obstacle),
 backend: django,
 database: neo4j or similar,
 further sophistication: user can multiplex the params to change the graph content and viewing style
