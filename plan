the current plan is: will use the lego dataset analytics video from youtube to take the themes for graphs


sample django project idea:

a site that takes in text data and turns it into structural data and builds a knowledge graph on it and then visualize
 it in the site,

 frontend: vue (to eradicate extra development obstacle),
 backend: django,

 database: postgres (neo4j or similar won't be suited with django orm - which is one my main goals to learn here)
 further sophistication: user can multiplex the params to change the graph content and viewing style
